# Play with Slick 3.1

This project shows Play working with Slick.  

This project is configured to keep all the modules self-contained. 

* Slick is isolated from Play, not using play-slick.  
* Database migration is done using [Flyway](https://flywaydb.org/), not Play Evolutions.
* Slick's classes are auto-generated following database migration.

## Database Migration use mysql

```
//sbt flyway/flywayMigrate    //First temporarily does not support, need to manually create a mysql database and table
```

## Slick Code Generation

You will need to run the flywayMigrate task first, and then you will be able to generate tables using sbt-codegen.

```
sbt slickCodegen
```

## Testing

You can run functional tests against an in memory database and Slick easily with Play from a clean slate:

```
sbt clean flyway/flywayMigrate slickCodegen compile test
```

## Running

To run the project, start up Play:

```
sbt run
```


And that's it! 
 
Now go to [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000), and you will see the list of users in the database.
